# Minecraft Skin Hex Editor Helper

A simple Python script to convert Minecraft skin PNG files to and from a text-based grid of hexadecimal color codes.

## Use Case

This tool was primarily created to facilitate editing Minecraft skins, especially when collaborating or using Large Language Models (LLMs) for assistance.

By converting the skin image into a plain text grid of hex codes:

1. You can easily pinpoint and communicate specific pixel changes by referring to line and position within the text file.
2. You can provide this text representation to an LLM (like ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.), describe the desired modifications (e.g., "change the shirt color," "add texture to the hair," "make the eyes green"), and have the LLM generate the updated text grid.
3. The script ensures that the dimensions and pixel data remain correctly structured when converting back to PNG, avoiding common pitfalls of manual pixel editing or LLM image generation inaccuracies.

This allows for precise, pixel-level editing using natural language instructions, leveraging the capabilities of LLMs.

## Features

- Converts standard Minecraft skin PNGs (e.g., 64x64) to a `.txt` file.
- Each pixel is represented by its `#RRGGBBAA` hex code (Red, Green, Blue, Alpha).
- Pixels are arranged in the text file exactly as they appear in the image grid.
- Converts the text grid file back into a valid PNG skin file.
- Handles transparency correctly.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pillow library (Python Imaging Library fork)
- `uv` ([link](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) or a standard Python environment capable of running scripts and installing packages)

## Installation

When using `uv`, you don't need to install any additional packages. If you are using a standard Python environment:
```bash
pip install Pillow
```

## Usage

The script `skin_editor.py` is run from the command line using `uv run` (or `python skin_editor.py` if not using `uv`).

**Arguments:**

- `mode`: The conversion direction.
    - `png2txt`: Convert a PNG image file to a text hex grid.
    - `txt2png`: Convert a text hex grid file to a PNG image.
- `-i` or `--input`: Path to the input file (e.g., `steve.png` for `png2txt`, `steve_hex.txt` for `txt2png`).
- `-o` or `--output`: Path to the output file (e.g., `steve_hex.txt` for `png2txt`, `steve_edited.png` for `txt2png`).

**Examples:**

1. **Convert PNG to Text Hex Grid:**

```bash
uv run skin_editor.py png2txt -i steve.png -o steve_hex.txt
```

This reads the example `steve.png` skin and creates `steve_hex.txt` containing the hex codes.

2. **Convert Text Hex Grid back to PNG:**

```bash
uv run skin_editor.py txt2png -i steve_hex.txt -o steve_new.png
```

This reads `steve_hex.txt` (which you might have edited manually or with an LLM's help) and creates a new skin file `steve_new.png`.

## Editing the Text File

- Open the `.txt` file generated by the `png2txt` command in any text editor.
- Each line corresponds to a row of pixels in the skin.
- Each `#RRGGBBAA` code on a line corresponds to a pixel in that row.
- **Crucial:** When editing, ensure you maintain the exact grid structure. Every line MUST have the same number of hex codes, and the total number of lines must not change. Use only valid 8-digit hexadecimal codes prefixed with `#`. Incorrect formatting will likely cause errors during the `txt2png` conversion.

## Example Skin

An example skin, `steve.png` ([link](https://www.planetminecraft.com/skin/original-steve-skin-5358663/)), is included in this repository for you to test the conversion process.
